1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. "values added: 20" 
2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. "final result: 20"
3. Why should you not use var? Explain why. Although line 13 is outside the block scope it can still access "result" because var is function-scoped which is why we shouldn't use it because it leads to unexpected behavior 
4. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. "values added: 20"
5. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. error because let is block scoped so the result variable is inaccessible outside the if block
6. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. it has an error by line 7 before line 9 because once you assign a value to const it can't be change. basically result is a constant at that point. 
7. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. it has an error by line 7 and it wont reach line 13 because once you assign a value to const it can't be change. basically result is a constant at that point. either ways const is a block scoped so if we didn't have an error in line 7 we still can't access it in line 13
